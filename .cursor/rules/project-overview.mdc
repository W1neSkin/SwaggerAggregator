# Swagger Aggregator - Project Overview

Multi-user web + mobile app that aggregates Swagger/OpenAPI specs from multiple services across environments.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Alembic
- **Frontend (Web)**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Frontend (Mobile)**: Expo (React Native), TypeScript
- **Shared**: TypeScript types + API client (npm workspace `@swagger-aggregator/shared`)

## Project Structure
- `backend/` — FastAPI app (models, schemas, routers, services)
- `shared/` — Shared TS types and axios API client
- `frontend/` — React web app (Vite)
- `mobile/` — Expo React Native app (Phase 6)
- `docker-compose.yml` — Local dev: backend + frontend + PostgreSQL

## Key Patterns
- Auth: JWT tokens (python-jose), bcrypt password hashing
- Secrets: Fernet encryption with per-user salt + MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY
- API client: shared axios client with pluggable TokenStorage adapter
- Each service has environments (local/dev/stage/prod), each with main + admin swagger
