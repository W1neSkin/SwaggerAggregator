# Shared Package Conventions

## Purpose
The `shared/` package contains TypeScript types and API client code shared between web and mobile.

## Rules
- All types must mirror the backend Pydantic schemas exactly
- API functions return typed data (not raw axios responses)
- Use `type` imports to avoid bundling issues with verbatimModuleSyntax
- TokenStorage interface allows web (localStorage) and mobile (SecureStore) adapters
- Never import platform-specific code here (no React, no React Native)

## Adding New API Endpoints
1. Add types in `shared/src/types/`
2. Add API function in `shared/src/api/`
3. Re-export from `shared/src/index.ts`
4. Use in frontend via `import { someApi } from "@swagger-aggregator/shared"`
